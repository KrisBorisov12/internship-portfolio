Plenty Time Wasted is an official company, owned by Martin Topalov. This is his first start-up. For this project I helped him design a custom 
font using his own hand writing. The font was developed using Photoshop, Illustrator, FontForge. Note! - The font only works with capital letters.

Apart from the font i helped him design a couple of logos and merch design.
