Diceroll Print (prior Diceroll Digital) is an unofficial startup company developed my Christiyan Zarkov. The services this company offers are
making custom 3D prints. While struggling to start up I helped Mr. Zarkov with the design of the prints and figures. These first figures were
based after Bulgarian Internet celebrities. Later these figures were gifter each to their coresponding celebrity and a video promotion was made
for each and every one of them. 

My contribution is helping model the figures and make the props that exist in some of them. After that, the figures were printed out and nad colored.
